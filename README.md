# orgASMR
A head-scratching musical interface ([demo here](https://youtu.be/6NVlh2iXAhg?si=KRFlqOaPS_G3fDrd))

## Overview
Designed for Stanford CCRMA's [MUSIC 250A](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/courses/250a-winter-2019/) class, the orgASMR is an adaptation of the popular "Head Scratcher" which takes ASMR (autonomous sensory meridian response) to the next level. It produces trance-like audio effects by detecting the amount of flex from the head scratcher's legs and the orientation of the handle. It also includes volume control and an on/off button. Combining the simplicity of chord progression with the intricacy of movement, the orgASMR is sure to blow your mind.

## Notes
- Uses [FAUST](https://faust.grame.fr/) programming to process output from Arduino microcontroller into sounds
- Uses Arduino programming to handle physical input
